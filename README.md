A simple python script that lets you send commands to Dion's desk. 

This script relies on the python plugin requests.
You can install requests with ```pip install requests```

You can run the script directly which will move Dion's desk up and down randomly, driving him slowly insane with ```python annoy_dion.py``` or import it and instruct his desk to move up and down with ```annoy_dion.up()``` to go up, ```annoy_dion.down()``` to go down and ```annoy_dion.stop()``` when you're done moving his desk.

Have fun. He won't.
